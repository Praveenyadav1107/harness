# ============================================
# OPA Policy: Production Deployment Governance
# ============================================
# This policy enforces enterprise security standards:
#   1. No deployments on Friday after 5 PM (prevent weekend incidents)
#   2. Production deployments must have an Approval stage
#
# How to use in Harness:
#   1. Go to Project Settings -> Governance -> Policies
#   2. Create new policy with this Rego code
#   3. Create Policy Set -> attach to pipeline
#   4. Entity Type: Pipeline
#   5. Event: On Run
#   6. Enforcement: Error and Exit (blocks pipeline)
# ============================================
