## Step 1: Create ECS Infrastructure

1. **Add GitHub Secrets/Variables** (one-time):
   - Go to GitHub repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
   - Add **Variable**: `HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID` → your Harness Account ID (from Account Settings → Overview)
   - Add **Secret**: `HARNESS_DELEGATE_TOKEN` → your Delegate Token (from Project Settings → Delegates → Tokens → copy `default_token` or create new)

2. GitHub → Actions → **"ECS Fargate Terraform"** → Run workflow → `action: apply`
3. Wait ~2 minutes
4. Output: ECS Cluster + ALB URL + ARNs
5. Delegate auto-installs on ECS Fargate and connects to Harness (wait 2 min → Harness UI → Delegates → Connected ✅)

---

## Step 1.2: Create Project Variables (One-Time — from Terraform Output)

Go to **Project Settings → Variables** and create these (values from "ECS Fargate Terraform" GitHub Actions output):

| Variable Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `ecs_alb_name` | `online-shopping-alb` |
| `ecs_prod_listener_arn` | Your Prod Listener ARN (port 80) |
| `ecs_stage_listener_arn` | Your Stage Listener ARN (port 8080) |
| `ecs_blue_target_group_arn` | Your Blue Target Group ARN |
| `ecs_subnet_1` | Your first subnet ID (from Terraform output) |
| `ecs_subnet_2` | Your second subnet ID (from Terraform output) |
| `ecs_security_group_id` | Your ECS security group ID (from Terraform output) |
| `ecs_task_execution_role_arn` | Task Execution Role ARN (from Terraform output) |
| `ecs_task_role_arn` | Task Role ARN (from Terraform output) |

> Get these values from GitHub Actions → "ECS Fargate Terraform" → last successful Apply run → Summary tab

## Step 2: Create Service in Harness UI

1. CD → **Services** → **+ New Service**
2. Name: `online-shopping` (ID auto-generates as `onlineshopping`)
3. Setup: **Inline**
4. Deployment Type: **Amazon ECS**
5. **Manifests** → **+ Add Manifest**:
   - **Task Definition:**
     - Type: ECS Task Definition
     - Store: GitHub → Connector: `account.Github`
     - Repo: `Harness-CI-CD-Zero-to-Hero`
     - Manifest Identifier: `task_definition`
     - Git Fetch Type: Latest from Branch
     - Branch: `master`
     - File Path: `Episode-07/Online Shopping app/ecs/task-definition.json`
     - Submit
   - **Service Definition:** (click + Add Manifest again)
     - Type: ECS Service Definition
     - Store: GitHub → Connector: `account.Github`
     - Repo: `Harness-CI-CD-Zero-to-Hero`
     - Manifest Identifier: `service_definition`
     - Git Fetch Type: Latest from Branch
     - Branch: `master`
     - File Path: `Episode-07/Online Shopping app/ecs/service-definition.json`
     - Submit
6. **Artifacts** → **+ Add Artifact Source**:
   - Artifact Repository Type: **ECR**
   - Connector: `account.aws_account`
   - Artifact Source Identifier: `ecr_image`
   - Region: `us-east-1` (your region)
   - Registry ID: leave empty
   - Image Path: `online-shopping`
   - Tag: **Value** → `<+input>`
   - Submit
7. Save

---

## Step 3: Create Environment + Infrastructure in Harness UI

1. Reuse Environment: `development` (already created in Episode 6/7)
2. Inside `development` → **+ Infrastructure Definition**
3. Name: `ecs-fargate` (ID auto-generates as `ecsfargate`)
4. Deployment Type: **Amazon ECS**
5. Setup: **Inline**
6. Connector: `account.aws_account` (AWS OIDC connector)
7. Region: `US East (N. Virginia)`
8. Cluster: type manually → `online-shopping-cluster` (dropdown may not work without delegate — just type it)
9. Save

---

## Step 4: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Episode 7: Online Shopping ECS Blue-Green"
git push origin master
```

---

## Step 5: Import Pipeline

1. CD → Pipelines → **+ Create a Pipeline** → **Import from Git**
2. Connector: `Github`
3. Repo: `Harness-CI-CD-Zero-to-Hero`
4. Branch: `master`
5. YAML Path: `Episode-07/Online Shopping app/.harness/pipeline-ecs-cd.yaml`
6. Import

---

## Step 6: Run Pipeline

```
Stage 1: Build & Push to ECR ✅
Stage 2: Deploy to ECS Blue-Green ✅
  ├── EcsBlueGreenCreateService (deploys new task def to Green target group)
  ├── Health Check (Green target group healthy?)
  ├── EcsBlueGreenSwapTargetGroups (swap: users now hit Green)
  └── Rollback (auto on failure):
      └── EcsBlueGreenRollback (swap back to Blue — instant!)
```

---

## Step 7: Access App

From GitHub Actions apply output or AWS Console:
```
http://online-shopping-alb-XXXXXXXXX.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

---

## Blue-Green Flow

```
BEFORE:   ALB (port 80) → Blue TG → [v1 tasks]
DEPLOY:   ALB (port 8080) → Green TG → [v2 tasks]  (testing)
SWAP:     ALB (port 80) → Green TG → [v2 tasks]  (live!)
ROLLBACK: ALB (port 80) → Blue TG → [v1 tasks]  (instant!)
```

---

## Cleanup

```
GitHub → Actions → "ECS Fargate Terraform" → destroy → confirm: yes
```

Deletes: ECS services + cluster + ALB + VPC → $0

---

## Test Rollback

1. Run pipeline → success ✅ (app deployed)
2. Break `ecs/task-definition.json` — change health check path:
   ```json
   "command": ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8080/nonexistent || exit 1"]
   ```
3. Push → Run pipeline
4. Stage 1: Build passes ✅
5. Stage 2: ECS Blue Green Create Service → new tasks start → health check FAILS → **EcsBlueGreenRollback triggers** → ALB swaps back to old version instantly ✅

**Why this works:**
- New version deploys to Green target group
- Health check fails → Harness detects failure
- Rollback = swap ALB listener back to Blue (old version still running)
- Users never see downtime — instant switch

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "Cluster not found" | Run ECS Fargate Terraform apply first |
| "Service not found" | Create `online-shopping` in Harness Services UI |
| "No eligible delegates" | ECS doesn't need delegate — check AWS connector |
| Health check failing | Check container starts on port 8080, responds at `/` |
| Image pull error | Verify ECR repo `online-shopping` exists + image pushed |
